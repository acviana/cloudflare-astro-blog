> All other languages were for some reason inferior, and as a Python programmer, I was the member of an elite cabal of superhuman ultranerds, smarter than those childish Rails/JavaScript/PHP/whatever developers that couldn’t write a bubble sort or comprehend even basic algorithmic complexity, but more in touch with reality than the grey-bearded wizards of Lisp/Haskell/whatever that sat in their caves/towers/whatever solving contrived, nonexistent problems for people that don’t exist, or those insane Erlang programmers who are content writing sumerian cuneiform all day long. <http://jordanorelli.tumblr.com/post/31533769172/why-i-went-from-python-to-go-and-not-node-js>
