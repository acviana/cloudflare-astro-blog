**[DjangoCon Lightning Talk: Hello from Hubble](http://www.slideshare.net/alexcostaviana/djangocon-lightning-talk-hello-from-hubble "DjangoCon Lightning Talk: Hello from Hubble") ** from **[alexcostaviana](http://www.slideshare.net/alexcostaviana)**

Here are my slides from my lightning talk at the 2012 DjangoCon in Washington DC. It was my first talk at a conference so I was glad I got such a warm response. It would be nice to return next year with some working django sites!
