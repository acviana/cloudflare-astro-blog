[Top 30 Most Popular Stolen LinkedIn Passwords](http://mashable.com/2012/06/08/linkedin-stolen-passwords-list/) 

Seriously? "link" is the most popular stolen password? What's your bank password? "bank"? Or just "$"? I can't believe that LinkedIn even allows a 4-letter password.

I wonder what percent of the total passwords these top 30 represent.
