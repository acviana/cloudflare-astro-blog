description: Migrating from Next.js to Astro
---

I made a bunch of big changes to my blog to kick off 2026. I switched to the [Astro](https://astro.build/) framework with the [Astropaper](https://astro.build/themes/details/astropaper/) template and switched hosting providers to Cloudflare Workers (disclosure: I'm currently employed at Cloudflare which recently acquired Astro).

I'm really happy with the update! My blog now has search, a dedicated tags page, better typography, a reading progress bar, and overall better aesthetics. You can find the source code on [GitHub](https://github.com/acviana/cloudflare-astro-blog).

## 14 years and 4 blogs in one place

This is my 4th blog going as far back as 2012. I started tech blogging on Tumblr (!!), then transitioned to the Python Pelican framework hosted on GitHub.io, and my last blog was built with the Nextra framework and hosted on Vercel.

I started the process of collecting some of my previous writing in my last blog iteration. As part of this migration I finished that process and have now collected all my previous blog posts in one place for the first time. All my blogs posts are now tagged with `source-*` so you can see what came from where.

## Coding with agents

This project involved a lot of boilerplate configuration and metadata tweaking. This is not the kind of thing I have a ton of time for so it was the perfect project to check out the latest generation of agents with. I wrote basically no code directly for this project, instead pushing everything to Claude Code through OpenCode.

I'm very happy with both the final result of the blog and the experience of working with Agents at the start of 2026. I want to write more about the experience of working with Agents on this project later - but for now I just wanted to throw up a hello world.
