I'm excited I finally have a reason to learn JavaScript at work. The first thing, per the suggestion of my friend who does UX, was have work order me a copy of [JavaScript: The Good Parts](http://www.amazon.com/JavaScript-Good-Parts-Douglas-Crockford/dp/0596517742).

Excited to read through it but couldn't help laughing when I stumbled upon the size comparison between _JavaScript: The good Parts_ and _JavaScript: The Definitive Guide_.
