It's been a productive few days.

Got some stuff done:

  * Joined GitHub and have my eyes on a project I want to contribute to.
  * Asked my first question on Stack Overflow (got my answer a few hours later).
  * Working my way through JavaScript examples on [Code Academy](http://www.codecademy.com/).
  * Got IPython Notebook to work on my laptop, excited to play with that.

Still scratching my head on:

  * Getting IPython Notebook to work on my work computer because of some complications between the IPython in our central Python source and my local site-packages.
  * Getting Cygwin on my laptop to see my python install outside of the Cygwin drive tree.

Got some good programming projects lined up a work as well.

Feeling good, feeling like I'm moving along.
