I'm starting this blog with some experiments with 100-word posts. 

I'm not witty enough for Twitter, but I mostly don't want to argue with strangers. 
Writing a newsletter was fun, but my tiny ideas keep exploding into multi-page essays. 
The proofreading and editing buried me for weeks.

So I'm trying for \~100 words at a time.
About the length of a few tweets.
I mostly just want a place to jot down my thoughts. 
Some code, some math, some music.

Maybe I should just text my friends more.

But I like playing around with Markdown so here we are.
