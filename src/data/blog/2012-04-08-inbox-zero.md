I just watched [this](http://youtu.be/z9UjeTMb3Yk) Google Tech Talk on "Inbox Zero" by [Merlin Mann](http://www.merlinmann.com/). It wasn't as interesting as I expected but I did get some useful ideas from it. The biggest immediate change is that I put _everything_ from my inbox, all 9k+ messages, into a folder called DMZ. I'll slowly go through and sort those guys out. But in the meantime, my inbox has zero messages. A fresh slate. Now I have to set up my system to keep it at zero.
