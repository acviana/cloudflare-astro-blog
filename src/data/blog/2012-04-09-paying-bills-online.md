I just spent an hour paying a series of small bills, parking tickets, vehicle registration, toll fees, medical bills, etc. All were <$25. About half the time I just gave up and called the organization, sat on hold, and paid over the phone. Some trends I saw:

  * Why are these pages so ugly? Look at a clean page, look at your page. Recognize the problem.
  * Why do the names of things change across your pages and documents. Account number, member number, user number, etc.
  * Why do different divisions have different billing pages. You have one company. Give me one billing portal.
  * You already have my email. I give it to you every time I interact with you.
  * Why am I hunting through menus and sidebars for what I want. Guide me, don't send me on what you think is a logical hunt.
  * Why do I have to keep typing in my credit card number. There has to be a better way. Hell, why isn't there a card reader on my laptop. I'd rather scan it every time than have the numbers sitting in a cache somewhere.
  * Why do you send anything in bulk mail ever?
